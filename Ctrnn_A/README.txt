The file ctrnn_2.py, that can be executed by "python3 ctrnn_2.py", contains the code that evolves by using genetic algorithms, one agent that is supossed to follow the 6 lights that appear in the field.
This agent has plasticity to archieve homeostatic behaviour.

At the end of the execution (6 to 8 hours in my case), something like the following will appear in console:

with the term "XXXXXX" being the total value of the fitness function archieved by this agent, wich is supossed to be the best one.

In order to visually see how the agent behaves, you just have to copy everythin from above, but not the fitness value:

And paste it in "individual = []" inside ctrnn_test.py file. By executing it with "python3 ctrnn_test.py" a graph with all the paths will appear.
	Red triangles are lightsources. The number at their side is the order in wich they appeared (from 0 to 5)
	Blue dot without a number is the initial position of the agent.
	Blue line is the agent path.
	Blue dots with numbers are the final position of the agent for that number light source. For example, blue dot with a 4 represent the point where the agent has stopped when the light 4 went off. -> blue dot with a 3 was the position where the agent was at the end of the light 3 and at the begining of the light 4.
